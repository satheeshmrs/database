## What Azure Cognitive Search Is

Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud-based search-as-a-service provided by Microsoft.

Traditionally, it has been a full-text search engine (similar to Elasticsearch), supporting keyword-based queries, faceted navigation, and ranking.

It integrates with AI-powered enrichments (OCR, entity recognition, translation, etc.) to preprocess and index unstructured data.

## Vector Capabilities in Azure Cognitive Search
In 2023–2024, Microsoft added vector search capabilities to Azure Cognitive Search.

This means it can now:

- Store and index vector embeddings generated by models (e.g., OpenAI’s embedding API).

- Perform vector similarity search (cosine, dot product, Euclidean).

- Combine keyword search + vector search into a hybrid search (best of both worlds: semantic + keyword matching).

So while Azure Cognitive Search was not originally a vector database, it has evolved into a vector-capable search engine.
