## semantic Search

Semantic Search is a technique that improves search accuracy by understanding the context and meaning of search terms, rather than just matching keywords. In the video, the instructor demonstrates this using a vector database. Here's a brief overview:

- Context Understanding: It looks at the meaning behind the search terms.
- Vector Databases: Data is embedded into vectors, allowing the search engine to measure the distance between vectors.
- Relevance: This helps in finding the most relevant results based on the context of the query.

This approach is particularly useful for complex datasets, providing more accurate and meaningful search results.
